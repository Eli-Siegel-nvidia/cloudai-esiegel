# THE FLOW
# When "node-health-test" is done, we take "main-test":
# 1. Check, if "node-health-test" is successful, if so â€” simply run "main-test"
# 2. If "node-health-test" is failed, we extract the nodes that a faulty and calculate number of "good" nodes
# in-a-loop:
# 11. exclude one faulty node from the "node-health-test" job
# 12. get the list of "good" nodes
# 13. If the number of "good" nodes is < "main-test.num_nodes", job fails
# 14. If the number of "good" nodes is >= "main-test.num_nodes", re-run "node-health-test" on smaller number of nodes
# 3. we run "main-test" on the "good" nodes using "main-test.nodes" field

# ???
# 1. What if "good" nodes are allocated between our runs?
# 2. This introduces an expectation on "node-health-test" job type, should be NCCL only
